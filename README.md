An input dialog which reads an integer value from the user. The dialog accepts only digit
characters. All non-digit characters, except 'd', are ignored and not even echoed on the screen.
The 'd' character is used to delete the very last digit from the input, i.e. it plays the role 
of BACKSPACE. The dialog is closed either when the user presses the RETURN key or the ESCAPE
key. Pressing the RETURN key means that the user confirms his input. Pressing the ESCAPE key
means that the user cancels his input. 

The dialog occupies two lines. The top line contains the prompt, while the bottom line is
where the user types his input.
